# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" or go to https://github.com/new
3. Repository name: `bookRentApp` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: `Microservices-based Book Store & Rental Platform with Spring Boot and CI/CD`
5. Choose Public or Private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bookRentApp.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all 52 files uploaded
3. Check that the CI/CD workflows are visible in the "Actions" tab

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)

In your GitHub repository settings, add these secrets:

### Required Secrets:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS secret key
- `AWS_REGION` - Your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack webhook for notifications (optional)

### Database Secrets:

- `DB_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL password
- `REDIS_PASSWORD` - Redis password
- `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` - RabbitMQ password

## Step 5: Test CI/CD Pipeline

1. Make a small change to any file
2. Commit and push the change
3. Check the "Actions" tab to see the CI/CD pipeline running
